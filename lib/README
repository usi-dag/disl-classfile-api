This directory contains libraries required for DiSL compilation. Initially, it
only contains this README and the 'artifacts.lst' file which contains a list
of expected dependency artifacts. When building DiSL using Ant, the
dependencies will be automatically downloaded using the Ivy dependency
manager. The retrieval of dependencies can be forced by running 'ant
download-deps' from the project's base directory.

After downloading the dependencies, this directory will contain several
subdirectories with artifacts required by the build process. The contents of
those directories will be checked against the contents of 'artifacts.lst'
during build initialization to make sure that all required dependencies are
present before starting the build.

The contents of this directory are not affected when running 'ant clean' and
have to be cleaned explicitly using 'ant clean-deps'.
